1. Neck
• Measure around your neck at the height where your collar, if buttoned, would be.
• This measurement should be taken along the lower section of the neck,below your Adams Apple and above your Sternal Notch.
• The tape should be comfortably touching the skin, with enough room so that you do not feel restricted.

2. Full Chest
• Measure around the chest and body at its fullest part (typically right under the armpits and shoulder blades, right across the nipples).
• Hold the tape against the body tight enough so that it does not slip down, but not so tight that it restricts breathing. It should be “snug”.
• Make sure the tape is horizontal and the person's arms are by their side; then take a normal breath and measure.
• Do not puff out your chest
• Double check this measurement.

3. Full Shoulder Width
• Measure from the end of the right shoulder to the end of the left shoulder.
• We define the “End of the Shoulder” as where the horizontal plane of the shoulder intersects the vertical plane of the arm (see illustration).
• Double check measurement. 

4. Right Sleeve
• Measure from the end of the right shoulder to the “Pinch” of the right hand.
• The “Pinch” of the hand is found where the base of the thumb and the base of the index finger intersect (approximately 1 inch above the index finger knuckle).
• Double check this measurement. 

5. Left Sleeve
• Measure from the end of the left shoulder to the “Pinch” of the left hand.
• Double check this measurement. 

6. Bicep

10. Front Jacket Length

11. Front Chest Width
• With the person's arms by their side, measure across the front of the chest.
• Start at the front of the right armpit, continue measuring across the nipples, and then stop at the front of the left armpit. Do not measure under the arms.

13. Half Shoulder Width (Right)

• We define the “Side of the Neck” as the point at which the vertical plane of the neck intersects the horizontal plane of the shoulder. 

14. Half Shoulder Width (Left)
• Measure from the end of the left shoulder to the base of the left side of the neck. 

15. Full Back Length
• Measure from the base of the back of the neck to the floor.
• We define the “base of the back of the neck” as the point at which the 7th cervical bone is located. To easily find this point, have the person being measured tilt his head forward so that the “knobby” bone at the base of the neck becomes obvious. Once located, you can have the person stand straight again and then measure.
